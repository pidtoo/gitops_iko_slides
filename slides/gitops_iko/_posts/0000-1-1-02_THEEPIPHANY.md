## Greet

This slide shows a background of Dan and Ron standing together, Ron is wearing an InterSystmems hoodie, Dan is wearing a Kubernetes hoodie.  Dan is eating a giant chocolate candy bar with the ArgoCD wrapper on it, Ron is eating out of a what appears to be a bucket of Peanut Buter with an intersytems logo on it.  Callout bubbles will be in the images representing bullshit acronyms flying out of mouths from our opposing camps.

(In case you dont know where this is going, its going to emulate the 70's commercial for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.)

## Awkward, Post Covid Bro Hug

This slide shows a background of Dan and Ron awkwardly completing a bro hug, which results in the Chocolate Bar going into the Peanut Butter.

Ron: Dude, you got your gitops in my intersystems, Dan: you got your intersystems in my Gitops!

## Epiphany

This slide has an image background that is the classic four frame internet meme where each one zooms in a little bit more with the final one resulting in the zoom of a facial expression.  The image will be a front forward picture of Ron with an enlightened look on my face, and in the background, Dan looking down trying to wipe a mess off his kubernetes sweatshirt.

## Solution

This slide has an image background that has a picture of the fictious bucket and a chocolate bar in it... it will have two callout arrows and a heart pointing to the intersystems logo on one side and argo on the other.
