## ConfigMaps As yaml
Dont get confused with the relationship of CPF to ConfigMap, manage the ConfigMap directly.

## Work Backwards
Once you get everything running and you have the simplest sample running from the docs, just `describe` everything to see what is going on under the hood.

## Get Default Helm Values
If you are adding other solutions/charts to augment your solution, spit out the default values to see what is available for the chart.  Also, beware of changes between releases.

```
helm get values "release-name-in-repo"
```

Below generates a password for your IRIS workloads (and the Druidia AirShield) and should be included in your configmap (or cpf).
