## What is Markdown Slides?

A template project for a Github page

- to quickly create beautiful slides and share them on freely hosted Github pages
- it is based primarily on Markdown &rarr; easy collaboration and version control
- you can host multiple presentations
- to see its full power, just check the [examples](#/03_examples)

It is powered by [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/), an awesome project by [Hakim El Hattab](https://twitter.com/hakimel) and based on and inspired by [reveal-jekyll](https://github.com/tasmo/reveal-jekyll) by [Thomas Friese](https://twitter.com/_tasmo)

## How to use it?

To set up a [project site](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages) that is reachable on `https://{yourname}.github.io/{projectname}`:

- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [project]({{site.githuburl}}) and give it a name `{projectname}`
- Basis for the website is the `gh-pages` branch, so you should [set that as the default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/)
- In [\_config.yml](./_config.yml) in your `gh-pages` branch, change `baseurl: ""` to `baseurl: /{projectname}`

To run the website on your local machine, you need to [install](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) Jekyll.

## How to add a new presentation?

To add a new presentation called `{my_presentation}`

- create `{my_presentation}.md` in the main directory
  - by copying `getting_started.md`
  - and adjust the configuration
- create a folder `slides/{my_presentation}/_posts`
- add your markdown files in this folder

## How to create slides? (1/3)

- create a markdown file for each section/chapter/ ...
  - you can choose this freely (also all slides in one file is possible)
  - new files are needed for references, i.e. jumping to different sections
- each markdown file should start with `0000-1-1-` and is followed by its name to make referencing possible
- e.g. `0000-1-1-00_Overview.md`, where `00_Overview` is the file name
  - to refer to the slides in this file link to `#/00_Overview`
  - if you do not use the prefix `0000-1-1-` you can references files by using their full name without the file ending `.md`
- slides are shown in the alphabetical order of their file names

---

## How to create slides? (2/3)

- the content of the slides is written in simple markdown
- slides within a markdown file need to be separated by three `-`
- e.g.

  ```markdown
  ## Slide 1

  Text on slide 1

  -&nbsp;-&nbsp;-

  ## Slide 2

  - List on slide 2
  ```

  - note that you need to remove the space between the `-` to make it work

- the best way is to check these [slides on Github]({{site.githuburl}}/tree/gh-pages/slides/getting_started/_posts)

---

## How to create slides? (3/3)

If you want to use assets, such as images

- create a folder `assets/slides/{my_presentation}`
- use `{&nbsp;{ asset_folder }&nbsp;}` to reference to the file location
  - e.g. if you want to add and image from that folder
  ```html
  <img src="{&nbsp;{asset_folder}&nbsp;}/latex_marker.JPG" />
  ```
  - note that the spaces are not necessary
