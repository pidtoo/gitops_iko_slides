## Create a Cluster

```python[1-19]
import random
import string
import google.auth
import google.auth.transport.requests
from google.cloud import container_v1
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from os.path import expanduser
from os import getenv
from string import punctuation

class GoogleCloudKubernetesClient(object):

    def __init__(self, project_id, zone):
        file = f'/home/sween/.gcp/pidtoo-fhir.json'
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            filename=file)
        thinger = "/projects/pidtoo-fhir/locations/us-east4a"
        self.project_id = "pidtoo-fhir"
        self.zone = "us-east4-a"
        self.client = container_v1.ClusterManagerClient(credentials=credentials)

```

Its a small guy, about $100 USD a month

## Create a Cluster

```python[4-12]
def cluster_spec(name, project):
    cluster_data = {
    "name": name,
    "network": "projects/pidtoo-fhir/global/networks/default",
    "addons_config": {
      "gce_persistent_disk_csi_driver_config": {
        "enabled": True
      }
    },
    "subnetwork": "projects/pidtoo-fhir/regions/us-east4/subnetworks/default",
    "node_pools": [
      {
        "name": name + "-pool",
        "config": {
          "machine_type": "g1-small",
```

Adjust the object as needed.
